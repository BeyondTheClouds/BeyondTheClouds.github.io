Agenda Proposal: 
        * Introduction of each partner (5 minutes per institution): 
        Name
a - Country
      b - General  Description
c - Expertise for the project
d - Expectations w.r.t the Discovery Initiative (which challenges are you interested in particular) 
e - Number of persons brought to the project (approximately in terms of Engineers/Researchers)

      1./ BSC - http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/storage-systems
Contact : Ramon Nou 
a - Spain
b - Public research center, with several departments and teams. Our group is dedicated to storage systems, from lower level issues (i.e. kernel) to higher layers including Wan Filesystems (participated on XtreemFS)
c - Storage and resource manager issues (Scheduling), caching, deduplication. Simulation.
d - Research on Data scheduling (related with energy efficiency issues), how to distribute VM data in such environment. VM data distribution to enforce fast start.
e - 1 engineer FT (granted by the call)/ 1 researcher (half time) is the target.

2./ CRS4 - http://www.crs4.it/distributed-computing
Contact Paolo Anedda
a - Italy (Sardinia)
b - A private (but owned by the local government) research institution dedicated to support science and tecnology.
c - VE deployment, VMs filing and massive data storage management, large-scale distributed infrastructures modeling and optimization
d - VE deployment, Suspend/Resume reliability of VEs  + theoretical model of Discovery (advantage in terms of performance, cost energy ....)
e - 1 engineer FT/ 1 researcher FT is the target (Expected grants) 

3./ GRNET
Contact: Panos Louridas
a - Greece
b - GRNET is the Greek NREN (National Research and Education Network).
c - Apart from providing network connectivity, GRNET has been involved in many years in grid computing and more recently in Cloud Computing.
     GRNET has built and maintains the synnefo cloud stack, which is OpenStack compatible, and uses Google Ganeti. 
     GRNET uses the synnefo cloud stack to power the okeanos cloud infrastructure, offering thousands of VMs to Greek researchers for the last two years.
     GRNET has extensive experience in virtualisation, running production cloud infrastructures, and interfacing between cloud infrastructures.
d - Interested in making the Discovery initiative work with an OpenStack compatible API: start, stop, move VMs as required by the LUCos using the OpenStack API using our synnefo cloud stack and okeanos installations as test beds
e - Two full time persons (initial estimation); that's our estimate for the engineering part of the project. We can add more people if required. Also, if we will be running some micro datacenters, we would need to add some effort for that 
    administration, but this would be amortised for all installations, so it would run up to no more than 0.5 FTE / year.

4./ Inria (Coordinator)
Contact : Adrien Lebre
a - France
b - A public science and technology institution dedicated to computational sciences in France
      c - VM placement/scheduling, VM simulator, security, peer-to-peer algorithm, Energy 
Simulator (Simgrid) / Grid'5000 Testbed
            d - short term - Autonomic federation/orchestration of widely distributed resources to operate Virtual Environments
middle/long term - add efficient, secure and reliable capabilities. 
e - Not yet clearly defined (for the moment - 6*4 PM/researchers/year)

            5./ PSNC -  http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/page/674/
            Contact : Roman Lapacz (Network department)
            a - Poland
b - PSNC is the public research and development centre, operator of national education network PIONIER, metropolitan area network POZMAN and the owner of high performance computing centre;
c - network management and monitoring in the intra- and inter-domain network environment; testbeds, analysis, software design and development, testing
d - networking solutions (virtualisations, SLA, SDN, etc.) in the clouds
e - Not yet defined (few engineers not fulltime but depends to the tasks/involvments in the project)
            
            6./ Orange
            Contact: T. Coupaye
            a - France

c- Network management and monitoring - hosting compute and storage resources in our POPs
d- Deploying new cloud services
e- To be defined  (depending on the project progress - not fulltime persons)

        * Question of SMEs/other industrials in the consortium
        Deutsch Telekom (contacted but no reply  yet)
List of SMEs candidates :
Orange - peerialsm (CDN P2P approaches, already contacted, could join the telco)
Inria - nonstop
CRS4 - CIAM Servizi S.p.A. (they have a distributed infrastructure of renewable energies adn they sell energy. the idea is to put also computer at each point of energy, probably a bit too prospective but the Discovery OS can be a solution for helping them to do that)
Inria -  Aoterra (quite similar, data furnaces)
CRS4 - Telecom Italia (no direct contact, check with G. Zanetti from CRS4) 
CRS4 - Tiscali (An Italian ISP, that provides also services)
 Stratio - Toni will contact them
Intercom  (CDN)
CRS4 (sequencer+computing facilities t / biology concerns / see whether they can benefit from the LUC infrastructure)


        * Envisioned use cases
        1./ Deliver cloud computing capabilities (i.e. IaaS ones) by directly leveraging existing backbone infrastructures
lead time to delivery 
Traffic isolation
reliability of resources/services
2./ CDN on demand, P2P youtube/dailymotion 
3./ MOOCs,  a kind of streaming services but with interactivity 
For the moment, we have CDN use cases
Regarding contacting other Telcos, pleas
e wait the answer of DT. 
Deploy specific infrastructures on demand (GPU clusters / tesbeds /)
4./ Flavien Q. =  Distributed data processing / hybrid cloud
        -1 sub use case could be the following one:
                *Users / companies can run small tasks on their own machines (using resource managers like Condor ~ desktop computing)
                *They can use more (powerful) machines hosted in PoPs to run the biggest tasks (in the same way companies buy network capacities to GIX to benefit from the best bandwidth / latency to have access to the Internet)
5./ Ramon N. "big data" use case: it is related with telecom companies and smart cities, analyzing mobile phone data directly from the antennas placement. It can be used for disaster prevention or city planification.

It may make sense to launch VM's near the nodes where the data is generated


        * Short presentation of ICT-7
        http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/83-ict-07-2014.html#tab1
        Research and Innovation actions 
Action primarily consisting of activities aiming to establish new knowledge and/or to explore the feasibility of a new or improved technology, product, process, service or solution. For this purpose they may include basic and applied research, technology development and integration, testing and validation on a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or simulated environment. 
Projects may contain closely connected but limited demonstration or pilot activities aiming to show technical feasibility in a near to operational environment. 
Funding rate: 100% 
Small Contribution : 2 - 4 EU Million
Large Contribution: 5 - 8 EU Million 
 A mix of proposals requesting Small and Large contributions is expected
66  millions for the call ICT-7-A for 2014
                
        * Brainstorming on possible Work Packages
(as a reminder :http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Adrien.Lebre/DISCOVERY-FACTSHEET/ )

WP 0 - Introductory
Use cases clarification
Business model (Orange / DT / Renater, lead time to delivery ? ) 
Requirement 
Outcome / expected results
Incentives
WP 1 - Architecture / Integration
Requirement identification 
Design the global architecture
Ensure the integration process 
WP 2 - Building blocks (Overlay, DHT,...)
Locality Aware Overlay (peer additions/removals / Resource Localization and Monitoring Mechanisms /...)    
Replication state mechanisms (to efficiently/reliably store LUC OS states)
Monitoring mechanisms  (performance, energy)
WP 3 -  VE management
Contextualization/Configuration of NICs
Dynamic scheduling (hot and cold migration throughout the infrastructure, which might include different domains)
Reliability 
WP 4 - VM Images
''Global Repository''
Deployment / snapshotting 
WP 5 - Security
Internal mechanisms of the LUC OS
Security of the VEs
WP 6 -  Application 
API to administrate/operate the LUC OS
API  for VM/VE management
API for locality 
WP 7  - Demonstrator
Use cases
Tesbeds
Simulators 
Grid'5000 Tesbeds
Representatives Testbeds: 
Leverage few PoPs and extend them with few servers in France / Poland and Greece
A link between private telco (Orange) and public NRENs, looks appealing but quite difficult)
we can ask some moneys to buy few servers but not for a complete infrastructure.
