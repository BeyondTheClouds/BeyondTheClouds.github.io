Context
-------

The emerging paradigm of decentralized Cloud infrastructures (DCIs) -
eg., Fog Computing, Swarm Computing, ...) place virtualized Cloud
resources at the network frontiers. These hybrid architectures
include standard data centers (DCs) and "integrated" peripherals, such
as PoPs that play the role of "mini-DSc." They have several
advantages: the geographical proximity of code and data, small
latencies, support for mobility ... Their heterogeneity,
however, underlies several critical security-related challenges:

1. Isolation breaches: security guarantees between two endpoints of a
   DCI are based on a strong isolation hypotheses between execution
   environments (VMs). In practice, this hypothesis is not valid,
   notably because of resource sharing (eg., of cache memory) between
   VMs in hypervisors. Such sharing entails indirect information flows
   (execution time, patterns of cache accesses) that can be exploited
   to steal of modify the data of clients.

2. Attack propagation: the heterogeneity of the virtualized
   architecture of an DCI may rapidly entail the propagation of
   attacks between the Cloud and embedded peripherals. Currently no
   unified isolation architecture for DCIs exists that provides an
   abstraction layer guaranteeing strong end-to-end isolation
   properties.

3. Applications: the DCI architectures are currently interesting for
   telecom-based Cloud operators because they harness their
   facilities. Protecting their security is therefore of high interest to
   telecom operators but requires strong end-to-end security guarantees
   including control over information flows.



Objective
---------

The principal objective of his PhD is the provision of strong
end-to-end isolation properties in the physical nodes of DCIs. To this
end, the PhD student will work on two challenges.

- A layer for distributed security that permits to abstract the
  heterogeneity of security techniques and to avoid the propagation of
  threats between the Cloud and embedded peripherals. The resulting
  new virtualization architecture will bridge the current semantic gap
  between the different forms of virtualization in the Cloud and among
  peripherals.

- A set of effective countermeasures against side-channel attacks
  (SCAs) that may target resources from the application level to the
  hypervisor level via hardware that is part of virtualized platforms
  in each node of a DCI.


The following results are targeted:

1. The design of the unified security architecture.

2. Its implementation in terms of a container architecture with better
   isolation properties than current approaches.

3. An integrated set of countermeasures to SCAs in form of a tool box
   that supports different trade-offs between security, performance,
   genericity, compatibility with existing approaches, for software
   operating from the IaaS to the SaaS level.

4. The integration of the preceding results in a realistic DCI
   prototype infrastructure.


The following problems are of particular interest in the context of
this thesis. As to isolation properties, a first problem consists in
the proposal of countermeasures against complete, i.e. multi-level,
attacks and not only attacks at a single hardware or software layer. A
second problem concerns countermeasures enabling different trade-offs
for the following properties: (1) the compatibility of different Cloud
platforms, i.e., requiring no or few modifications to virtualization
infrastructures; (2) supporting a high security level by removing or
reducing information leaks; (3) no reliance on a specific
hardware/software architecture.

As to attack propagation. the main problem consists in the
heterogeneity of architectures for virtualization between the Cloud
and embedded peripherals, a source of complexity and security
weaknesses by itself. This problem should be handled by a security
approach "by design" that provides end-to-end security guarantees.
