% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%\AL[AL]{1 page (including the abstract)}

Although a lot of progress has been performed on Cloud Computing (CC)
system managements, \aka Infrastructure-as-a-service
toolkits~\cite{moreno:2012}, most of them
are still leveraging
elementary Virtual Machine (VM) placement policies that prevent them
to guarantee performance Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
finely maximizing the usage of CC resources.
%to maximize the CC providers revenues.
%% THE TEXT BELOW COMES FROM ISPA'13
%%%%%%%
Generally, a batch scheduler
approach is used: VMs are
(i)~allocated according to user requests for resource reservations,
and (ii)~tied to the nodes where they were deployed until their
destruction. Besides the fact that user requests are often
overestimated, such policies are definitely not optimal for
CC providers, since the effective
resource requirements of each operated VM may significantly vary
during its execution.
%%%%%%%

Keep using  greedy allocation approaches in most of available IaaS
toolkits~\cite{openstack, opennebula, cloudstack} looks surprising
as the Virtual Machine Placement Problem (VMPP) has been addressed a
lot by the research community. Dynamic strategies such as
consolidation,  load-balancing and other SLAs guarantee algorithms
have been deeply investigated \cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300},\cite{feller:ccgrid12},
\cite{quesnel:cpe2012},
\cite{5935254}, \cite{5715067}, \cite{5328077}.
% under different software-architecture models (centralized
%\cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}, hierarchical
%\cite{feller:ccgrid12} or distributed \cite{quesnel:cpe2012}).
From our point of view, a brake on the adoption of such advanced strategies is
related to the experimental process that has been used to validate the
pros and cons of each of them: Most of VMPP proposals have been
evaluated either by leveraging ad-hoc simulators or on testbeds that
in both cases are not accurate and not representative enough to (i)
ensure their correctness on real platforms and (ii) perform fair
comparisons between each of them.
%
Implementing each proposal and evaluating them on representative
testbeds in terms of scalability, reliability and workload changes
would definitely be the most rigorous way to validate and compare all
of them. However, delivering a prototype and conducting
\textit{in-vivo} (\ie real-world) experiments imply, when it is
possible, expensive and tedious tasks that might be counterproductive
if conclusions are far from the expected ones.
%

In this article, we propose the first version of a dedicated
simulation framework to perform in-depth investigations and compare VM
placement algorithms with each other in a fairly way. To cope with
real conditions such as their increasingly scale of modern data
centers and the dynamicity of the workloads that are specific to the
Cloud Computing paradigm (\ie elasticity capability), our framework
allows users to study large-scale scenarios taking into account server
crashes and involving tens of thousands of VMs, each one executing a
specific workload that evolves during the simulation lifetime.

We believe that such a tool will contribute to
our community as it will enable researchers to quickly identify and
compare the trends of a new proposal with existing ones. By such a
mean, it will be possible to limit \textit{in vivo} experiments only
to the algorithms that have the potential to handle Cloud Computing
production infrastructures.

%
We chose to build our tool on the \sg
framework~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319} since (i) its relevance in
terms of performance and validity has already been
demonstrated~\cite{simgridpub} and (ii) the framework has been
recently extended to integrate virtual machine and live migration
models \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}.

To illustrate the relevance of our tool, we implemented three VMPP
mechanisms \cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}
\cite{feller:ccgrid12} \cite{quesnel:cpe2012} and analysis the pros
and cons of each them by discussing several metrics such as
scalability, reliability and reactivity (\ie the time to solve a SLA
violation). Besides being cited several times in the literature, we
chose these three systems as they are built on three different
software architecture models: centralized
\cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}, hierarchical
\cite{feller:ccgrid12} and fully distributed \cite{quesnel:cpe2012}.

The rest of the article is organized as follow. Section \ref{sec:sg}
gives an overview of the \sg framework.
\ref{sec:injector} introduces our tool and discusses its internals
The three algorithms implemented as first use-cases are presented in
Section \ref{sec:vm-schedulers} and evaluated in Section \ref{sec:experiments}
Section \ref{sec:related} deals with related work and
finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes and gives some perspective of this
work.

\section{Simgrid, a generic toolkit}
\label{sec:sg}
%\AL[AL]{0.5page}

\sg is a simulation toolkit to study the behavior of
large-scale distributed systems.  Developped for more than  a decade, It has been used in more than 100
publications.  Its main characterisitics are related to its:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extensibility -- After Grids, HPC and P2P
  systems, \sg has been recently extended with virtualization technologies abstractions
(\ie Virtual Machines including a live migration model \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}) to allow users to investigate Cloud
Computing challenges \cite{lucas:cloud2014};
\item Scalability -- It is possible to simulation large-scale scenarios,
  as an example, users can simulate applications composed of 2
  Millions of processors and to
  simulate an infrastructure with 10 000~servers hostings more than
  100 000 VMs on a computer with 16~GB of memory;
\item  Flexibility -- It allows to run a simulation on arbitrary network
  topology under dynamic computation and network resources
  availabilities;
\item API --  users can leverage \sg through eady-to-use APIs in C
  and Java.
\end{itemize}

To perform simulations, users should develop  a \emph{program} and define a
\emph{platform} file. The \emph{program} in most cases leverages the \sg MSG API
that allow end-users to create and execute \sg abstractions such as processes, tasks, VMs and
network-communications. The \emph{platform} file gives the physical
description of each resource composing the environment and on which
aforementioned computations/network exchanges will be performed in the
\sg world.% (host, CPU capacity, network topology and link capacities, etc.)
The execution of the program is orchestrated by the \sg engine that
internally relies on an constraint solver to correctly assign the
amount of CPU/network resources to each action, step by step until the
simulation ends.

Although SimGrid has many features such as model checking, the
simulation of DAGs (Direct Acyclic Graphs) or MPI applications, we
only give a brief description of the  virtualization  abstractions
that have been recently implemented in \sg and on which our framework relies
on.  Further information regarding \sg is available in \cite{casanova:hal-01017319}.

The VM support has been designed so that all operations that can be performed
o a host can be performed inside a VM: From the point of view of a \sg
Host, a \sg VM is considered as an ordinary task while from the point
of view of a task running inside a \sg VM, a VM is considered as an
ordinary host below the task.  By such a mean, \sg users can easily
switch between a virtualized and non virtualized infrastructure.
Moreover, thanks to  MSG API extensions, users can control VMs in the
same manner as in the real world (\eg create/destroy, start/shutdown,
suspend/resume and migrate).
% live migration
For migration operations, a VM live migration model implementing the
precopy migration algorithm of Qemu/KVM has been integrated into \sg.
This model is the only one that successfully simulates the live
migration behavior by taking into account the resource sharing
competition as well as the memory refreshing rate of the VM, thus
determining correctly the live migration time as well as the resulting
network traffic \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}.

In the following section, we present how we have leverage these latest
extensions of \sg to develop a generic framework for evaluating and
comparing VM placement algorithms.

\section{VM Placement Simulator}
\label{sec:injector}
\AL[AL]{1.5 page}

The purpose of the VM placement simulator is to deliver a generic tool
to evaluate new VM placement algorithms and offer the possibility to
compare them each other. Concretely, it consists of  a piece of code in charge of managing VM
creations, workload fluctuation changes as well as node apparitions/removals so
that researchers can focus on the implementation of the new placement
algorithm and evaluate how it behaves according to the different
changes that occur during the simulation.

The framework has been implemented in JAVA by leveraging the
corresponding MSG API of \sg.
\AL[JP]{Here we should add something like: This offer the opportunity
to researchers to develop new algorithms by using high level
programming abstractions such as JAVA or SCALA}

After giving an overview of the framework, we describe in details its
functioning and how researchers can develop new algorithms

\subsubsection{Overview}
At coarse-grained,
%an execution of our framework can be divided into
%two steps. During the first one, our framework instanciates as many
%VMs as indicated in the \texttt{Simulator.properties} file.
the framework can be
divided in two major parts: the \emph{injector} and the schedulers.

The \emph{injector} is the generic part of the framework. As its name
suggest, it is in charge of injecting the different events that occur
during the execution of the simulations. Current events are node
apparitions/removals  and VM CPU load changes.
% As we describe in the next section, additional events can be easily added.

The schedulers correspond to the  algorithms you want to study.
Currently, our framework is released with three algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item Entropy \cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}, a centralized approach using a constraint programming approach to solve the placement/reconfiguration VM problem;
 \item Snooze \cite{feller:ccgrid12}, a hierarchical approach where
   each manager of a group invokes Entropy to solve the
   placement/reconfiguration VM problem. It is noteworthy that in
   \cite{feller:ccgrid12}, Snooze is using a specific heuristic to solve the placement/reconfiguration VM problem. As the sake of simplicity, we have simply reused the entropy scheduling code.
\item  DVMS \cite{quesnel:cpe2012}, a distributed approach that dynamically partitions the system and invokes Entropy on each partition.
\end{itemize}

At the beginning, the simulation create n VMs, each of which is based on one of predefined VM classes. A VM class is a
template of the specification of a VM and its workload. It is described as
\texttt{nb\_cpu:ramsize:net\_bw:mig\_speed:mem\_speed}. VMs are launched on PMs in
a round-robin manner for the initial placement, \ie each PM has almost the same number of VMs.
According to the investigated algorithm, VMs are relocated through the
different PMs during the whole execution of the simulation in order to
ensure scheduling objectives and SLA guarantees.

It is noteworthy that our framework really invokes the execution of
each scheduling strategy. That is in the current algorithm,  Entropy instances are really invoked with the current configuration
handled by the simulator. Hence, the computation time that is observed
is not simulated but corresponds to the effective one, only the
workload inside the VMs and the migration operations are simulated in \sg.
%It is worth noting that in
% order to limit the computation time of the computation phase, we
% set a timeout equal to one fourth of the number of nodes
% considered (in seconds) for each Entropy invocation.
% This timeout was determined empirically by preliminary experiments with 512 and 1024 PMs.
% Last but not the least, the presented results do not address the cost of the
% third phase of the scheduling problem (i.e., the relocation actions). As SimGrid
% does not simulate VM migrations yet, the reconfiguration plan is only logically
% performed: When a VM needs to be migrated, we only change its location
% property.  The cost of VM migrations has been analyzed through real
% experiments conducted on Grid'5000 (cf.\ Section \ref{subsec:g5k-exp}).

\subsection{Injector}
The \emph{Injector} component is a dedicated \sg process s in charge of changing the VMs' load during the
simulation.  Concretely it selects every $t$ seconds one VM hosted on
the simulated infrastructure and changes its load according to a
Gaussian distribution. $t$ is a random variable that follows an
exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$ while the
Gaussian distribution is defined by a particular mean ($\mu$) as well
as a particular standard deviation ($\sigma$) that are given at each
simulation.  From the SimGrid point of view, a VM is just an
abstraction.  Hence changing the load of a VM corresponds to assigning
a new value to its CPU property.  Finally, we considered the size of
the memory assigned to a VM as a rigid resource (i.e., it is defined at
the beginning of each run and does not change).

Adding new events can be easily done by simply defining new event
classes and putting the associated law that model the periodicity of
each event. By default an exponential law is used but additional ones
can be added. For instance, we  are currently adding network events to
dynamically changes the network in/out usage of each VM during the
simulation).

% \item The second module of our simulator corresponds to the centralized
% version of the scheduling problem: This
% SimGrid Agent corresponds to an infinite loop that iteratively invokes
% Entropy by triggering a `repair process' that aims at satisfying the
% QoS properties of the VMs by leveraging all available PMs.
% By default the Entropy framework waits 30 seconds before triggering a new `repair
% process' but in order to be as reactive as possible, this time has been
% reduced to 1 second.

% \item Finally, the last module implements the DVMS proposal as previously described.
