\begin{abstract}
  The promotion of distributed Cloud Computing infrastructures as the next platform to
  deliver the Utility Computing paradigm, leads to new virtual machines~(VMs) scheduling
  algorithms leveraging peer-to-peer approaches. Although these proposals considerably
  improve the scalability, leading to the management of hundreds of thousands of VMs over
  thousands of physical machines~(PMs), they do not consider the network overhead
  introduced by multi-site infrastructures. This overhead can have a dramatic impact on
  the performance if there is no mechanism favoring intra-site \vs inter-site
  manipulations.
% %%%
%To reduce such an impact,  locality properties should be considered as a key
%element, e.g. PMs should collaborate first with their neighbourghood from the
%same geographical site before contacing remote ones.  As network
%bandwidth/latency fluctuate over time, using a static partitionning of the
%resources is not enough. 
%
%
%This paper introduces a new building block built on a vivaldi overlay that
%maximizes efficient collaborations between PMs. We combined this mechanism with
%DVMS , a large scale virtual machine scheduler and show its benefit by
%discussing several experiments performed on four distinct sites of the
%Grid'5000 tesbed. Thanks to our proposal and without changing the scheduling
%decision algorithm, the number of inter-site operations has been reduced by
%66%.  This result provides a glimpse of the promising future of locality
%properties to improve performance of massive distributed cloud platforms.

%In addition, as network properties (bandwidth, latency, sites interconnection)
%fluctuate over time, working with a static partitioning of the resources cannot
%be considered.

  This paper introduces a new building block designed on top of a network with Vivaldi
 coordinates maximizing the locality criterion (\ie efficient collaborations between PMs).
%\eg PMs should collaborate first with their neighbourghood from the
%same geographical site before contacing remote ones. 
  We combined such a mechanism with DVMS, a large-scale virtual machine scheduler and showed
  its benefit by discussing several experiments performed on four distinct sites of the
  Grid'5000 testbed. With our proposal and without changing the scheduling decision
  algorithm, the number of inter-site operations has been reduced by 72\%. This result
  provides a glimpse of the promising future of using locality properties to improve the performance
  of massive distributed Cloud platforms.
 
%Future works will focus on the use of such a locality aware mechanisms to revisit other 
%mechanisms in the context of distributed cloud computing management.
