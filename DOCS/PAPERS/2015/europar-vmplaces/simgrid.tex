% Developed for more than a decade,
% and used in a large number of studies described in mor than
% 100~publications,
\sg is a toolkit for the simulation of potentially complex algorithms
executed on large-scale distributed
systems~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319}.
%
To perform simulations, users develop a \emph{program}, and define a
\emph{platform} and a \emph{deployment} files. The \emph{program}
typically leverages \sg's MSG API that allows end users to create
and execute \sg abstractions such as processes, tasks, VMs and network
communications. The \emph{platform} file provides the physical
description of all resources that are the object of the simulation.
% composing the environment and on which aforementioned computations
% and network interactions will be performed in the \sg world.  (host,
% CPU capacity, network topology and link capacities, etc.)
The \emph{deployment} file is used to launch the different \sg
processes of the program on the simulated nodes.
% (at least the mapping between one process and one host is mandatory
% to start the simulation)
Finally, the simulation is orchestrated by the \sg engine that
internally relies on a constraint solver to assign the CPU/network
resources during the entire
simulation.% (for a complete overview see ~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319}).


We chose to base \vmps on \sg
since (i) the latter's relevance in terms of performance and validity
has already been demonstrated~\cite{simgridpub} and (ii) because it
has been recently extended to integrate VM abstractions and a live
migration model \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}. In addition
to enabling researchers to control VMs in the same manner as in the
real world (\eg create/destroy VMs; start/shutdown, suspend/resume and
migrate them), the model implementing the precopy migration algorithm
of Qemu/KVM is the only one that successfully simulates the live
migration behavior by taking into account the competition arising in
the presence of resource sharing as well as the memory refreshing rate
of the VM, thus determining correctly the live migration time as well
as the resulting network traffic. These two capabilities were
mandatory to build \vmps.%our VM placement simulator toolkit.
