% Most current infrastructures for cloud computing leverage static and
% greedy policies for the placement of virtual machines. Such policies
% impede the optimal allocation of resources and the satisfaction of
% operational guarantees like service-level agreements. In recent years,
% more dynamic and often more efficient policies based, \eg on
% consolidation and load balancing techniques, have been developed. Due
% to the underlying complexity of cloud infrastructures, these policies
% are evaluated either using limited scale testbeds/\emph{in-vivo}
% experiments or ad-hoc simulator techniques. These validation
% methodologies are unsatisfactory for two important reasons: they (i)
% do not model precisely enough real production platforms (size,
% workload representativeness, failure, etc.) and (ii) do not enable the
% fair comparison of different approaches.

% In this article, we propose \vmps, a dedicated simulation framework to
% perform in-depth investigations of VM placement algorithms and compare
% them in a fair way. Built on top of the \sg simulation platform, our
% framework provides programming support to easy the implementation of
% placement algorithms and runtime support dedicated to load injection
% and execution trace analysis. \vmps supports a large set of parameters
% enabling researchers to design simulations representative of
% real-world scenarios. We also report on a validation of our framework
% by evaluating three classes of placement algorithms: centralized,
% hierarchical and fully-distributed ones. We show that \vmps enables
% researchers (i) to study and compare such strategies, (ii) to detect
% possible limitations at large scale and (iii) easily investigate
%different design choices.

 Due to the underlying complexity of cloud infrastructures, advanced
 Virtual Machines (VM) placement policies are evaluated either using limited scale \emph{in-vivo}
experiments or ad-hoc simulator techniques. These validation
methodologies are unsatisfactory:
%to favor technological transfers to cloud production platforms: 
(i) they do not model precisely enough real production platforms (size,
workload representativeness, etc.); (ii) they do not enable the
fair comparison of different approaches; (iii) they hinder
technological transfers to cloud production platforms.

In this article, we propose \vmps, a dedicated simulation framework to
perform in-depth investigations of VM placement algorithms and compare
them in a fair way. Built on top of the \sg simulation toolkit, our
framework provides programming support to ease the implementation of
placement algorithms and runtime support dedicated to load injection
and execution trace analysis.
\vmps supports a large set of parameters enabling researchers to design simulations representative of
real-world scenarios.
%The accuracy of \vmps has been validated by comparing simulated and
%in-vivo execution on top of Grid'5000.
We also report on a validation
of our framework by evaluating three classes of placement algorithms:
centralized, hierarchical and fully-distributed ones.
