  abstract =     {{To accommodate the ever-increasing demand for
                  Utility Computing (UC) resources, while taking into
                  account both energy and economical issues, the
                  current trend consists in building larger and larger
                  data centers in a few strategic locations. Although
                  such an approach enables to cope with the actual
                  demand while continuing to operate UC resources
                  through centralized software system, it is far from
                  delivering sustainable and efficient UC
                  infrastructures. We claim that a disruptive change
                  in UC infrastructures is required: UC resources
                  should be managed differently, considering locality
                  as a primary concern. We propose to leverage any
                  facilities available through the Internet in order
                  to deliver widely distributed UC platforms that can
                  better match the geographical dispersal of users as
                  well as the unending demand. Critical to the
                  emergence of such locality-based UC (LUC) platforms
                  is the availability of appropriate operating
                  mechanisms. In this paper, we advocate the
                  implementation of a unified system driving the use
                  of resources at an unprecedented scale by turning a
                  complex and diverse infrastructure into a collection
                  of abstracted computing facilities that is both easy
                  to operate and reliable. By deploying and using such
                  a LUC Operating System on backbones, our ultimate
                  vision is to make possible to host/operate a large
                  part of the Internet by its internal structure
                  itself: A scalable and nearly infinite set of
                  resources delivered by any computing facilities
                  forming the Internet, starting from the larger hubs
                  operated by ISPs, government and academic
                  institutions to any idle resources that may be
                  provided by end-users. Unlike previous researches on
                  distributed operating systems, we propose to
                  consider virtual machines (VMs) instead of processes
                  as the basic element. System virtualization offers
                  several capabilities that increase the flexibility
                  of resources management, allowing to investigate
                  novel decentralized schemes.}},

                  this paper, we introduce the concept of a
                  Content-Addressable Network (CAN) as a distributed
                  infrastructure that provides hash table-like
                  functionality on Internet-like scales. The CAN is
                  scalable, fault-tolerant and completely
                  self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability,
                  robustness and low-latency properties through
                  simulation.}},
